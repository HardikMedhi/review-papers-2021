\hspace{0.5cm} General relativity is an important part of physics which helps us understand our universe in a large scale like black holes, gravitational waves and our expanding universe. It describes gravity as a property of space and time rather than a force as mentioned by Newton. It tells us that the curvature of space time is related to energy and momentum which is present inside matter. Einstein's feild equations also theorizes various phenomena such as the wrapping of space time and gravitational waves. It helps us to understand the region of space having black holes or neutron stars, or a system of dynamical heavy masses which causes great changes in gravity. We know that there are three dimensions of space which we can interact with. But Einstein included time also as the fourth dimension. Thus space time is four dimensional in nature, consisting of three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. When there is no matter, space time is flat, and the shortest distance between any two points will be a straight line. But in the presence of matter, the shape of space time is altered, making the shortest distance between two points a curved line, which is also known as a `Geodesic'.

If there are two giant masses orbiting around each other, it results in the formation of ripples in space time which is called as gravitational waves. These ripples move with the speed of light. The farther they move away from their source, the weaker they get. Hence the gravitational waves which are detected are very weak due to various reasons, but are good source of information.\\ 

In 1916, Einstein predicted that two bodies orbiting each other would not be in the same orbit all the time, instead they lose energy and in doing so emit gravitational waves. According to his mathematics he showed that two massive accelerating objects such as neutron stars or black holes, while orbiting each other, generate ripples and disrupt the space time causing waves which propagates in every direction away from the source. These ripples carry information about their origin and about gravity as well. The strongest gravitational waves are generated due to colliding black holes or neutron stars. After half a century, the first indirect proof of gravitational waves was given in the year 1974 when astronomers Jocelyn Bell and Antony Hewish discovered a pulsar which produced a gravitational wave. After this they observed how the stars changed their orbit as the time passes. They observed that the stars were getting closer to each other at the rate which was predicted by Einstein in his General Theory of Relativity by producing gravitational waves.\\ 

On September 14, 2015, LIGO detected a signal which was due to the collision of two massive black holes which occured 1.3 billion years ago. After analyzing the phenomena, it was observed that the wave was caused due to the objects which are 29 and 36 times more massive than the sun, orbiting with a speed of $58.33\,ms^{-1}$ just before they collided. The gravitational waves which were generated near the source were very large but by the time they were detected here on earth, their strength was so small that their effect on the LIGO was 10000 times smaller than a Proton.
